# simple_vision
Elementary projects for machine vision


This repository contains implementations of various computer vision techniques during my learning process using Python and OpenCV. The projects included cover a range of topics, from basic image processing techniques such as thresholding and morphology to more advanced topics such as object detection and recognition.

The goal of this repository is to provide simple, easy-to-understand implementations of these techniques, along with example images and explanations of the theory behind them. 

Some of the projects included in this repository are:
- Histogram equalization  
- Basic thresholding and morphology operations  

Each project is contained in its own directory, with its own README file explaining how to run the code and providing additional information about the project.  

NOTE: This project is still under developing.
