Implementation of Histogram Equalization from scratch on distorted license plate image on image-1 and image-2 

1- Load the distorted license plate images into your Python environment. You can use the OpenCV library.

2- Convert the images to grayscale. This is because Histogram Equalization works on grayscale images.

3- Calculate the histogram of the grayscale image.

4- Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the histogram.

5- Normalize the CDF to obtain the mapping function that will be used for Histogram Equalization.

6- Apply the mapping function to the grayscale image to obtain the Histogram Equalized image.

7- Save the Histogram Equalized image to disk.
