This project demonstrates how to implement basic thresholding and morphology operations from scratch to make the license plate numbers and letters more clear.

## Steps

1- Read the image 'image-3.jpeg' using the OpenCV imread function.
2- Convert the image to grayscale using the OpenCV IMREAD_GRAYSCALE flag.
3- Apply thresholding on the grayscale image.
4- Display and save the thresholded image using OpenCV.
5- Erode the binary image using a 5x5 kernel.
6- Display and save the eroded image using OpenCV.
